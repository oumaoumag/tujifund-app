# Interface-Based Design for Database Abstraction

## Overview

This document explains the interface-based design pattern used in the TujiFund/ChamaVault application's database abstraction layer. This pattern enables the application to work with both SQLite and PostgreSQL databases through a common interface.

## Interface-Based Design Principles

Interface-based design is a software engineering approach that defines behavior through interfaces (contracts) rather than implementations. In our database abstraction layer, we use this pattern to:

1. **Decouple the application from specific database implementations**
2. **Enable runtime switching between database systems**
3. **Facilitate testing through mock implementations**
4. **Support gradual migration from SQLite to PostgreSQL**
