# SQLite to PostgreSQL Migration Plan
Version: 2.0.0
Last Updated: [Current Date]

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step process for migrating the TujiFund/ChamaVault application database from SQLite to PostgreSQL. The migration will be performed in phases to ensure data integrity and minimize downtime. This plan implements a database abstraction layer first, allowing the application to work with both database systems during the transition period.

## Prerequisites
- [ ] PostgreSQL 15+ installed
- [ ] Backup solution implemented
- [ ] Development environment configured
- [ ] Access to all required credentials
- [ ] Team members notified and roles assigned

## Phase 1: Database Abstraction Layer

### 1.1 Infrastructure Setup
- [ ] Set up PostgreSQL servers (Dev/Staging/Prod)
- [ ] Configure network access and security
- [ ] Implement backup solutions
- [ ] Set up monitoring tools

### 1.2 Database Configuration Enhancement
- [ ] Update DBConfig structure to support both database systems
- [ ] Create configuration loader for environment variables and config files
- [ ] Implement connection string builders for both database types
- [ ] Add configuration validation logic

### 1.3 Database Driver Adapters
- [ ] Define common database interface for all operations
- [ ] Implement SQLite-specific adapter
- [ ] Implement PostgreSQL-specific adapter
- [ ] Create factory function to return appropriate adapter

### 1.4 SQL Dialect Handling
- [ ] Identify SQLite-specific SQL in the codebase
- [ ] Create SQL templates for different database types
- [ ] Update schema creation logic for database-specific SQL
- [ ] Handle differences in data types and functions

### 1.5 Application Code Updates
- [ ] Modify database initialization code
- [ ] Update query execution code
- [ ] Implement proper transaction handling
- [ ] Add database-specific feature detection

## Phase 2: Data Migration

### 2.1 Schema Migration
- [ ] Create PostgreSQL-compatible schema generation script
- [ ] Handle data type conversions (e.g., INTEGER to SERIAL)
- [ ] Create indexes and constraints
- [ ] Verify schema structure

### 2.2 Data Export and Import
- [ ] Develop data extraction tool for SQLite
- [ ] Create data import tool for PostgreSQL
- [ ] Handle data type conversions
- [ ] Preserve referential integrity

### 2.3 Migration Scripts
```sql
-- Example schema conversion
-- SQLite:
-- CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT)
-- PostgreSQL:
-- CREATE TABLE users (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY)

-- Example data migration
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION migrate_users() RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO users_pg (username, email, password_hash)
    SELECT username, email, password_hash FROM users_sqlite;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

## Phase 3: Testing

### 3.1 Abstraction Layer Testing
- [ ] Unit test both database adapters
- [ ] Test with SQLite configuration
- [ ] Test with PostgreSQL configuration (empty database)
- [ ] Verify all database operations work with both systems

### 3.2 Migration Testing
- [ ] Test schema conversion accuracy
- [ ] Test data migration integrity
- [ ] Verify referential integrity preservation
- [ ] Test rollback procedures

### 3.3 Performance Testing
- [ ] Measure migration speed with different data volumes
- [ ] Compare application performance between databases
- [ ] Validate connection pooling effectiveness
- [ ] Stress test both database systems

### 3.4 Integration Testing
- [ ] End-to-end migration testing
- [ ] Application functionality verification with both databases
- [ ] API response validation
- [ ] Security testing

## Phase 4: Staging Deployment

### 4.1 Staging Environment Setup
- [ ] Deploy abstraction layer to staging
- [ ] Set up PostgreSQL in staging environment
- [ ] Clone production data to staging
- [ ] Perform full migration in staging

### 4.2 Validation and Testing
- [ ] Run application with SQLite in staging
- [ ] Switch to PostgreSQL and verify functionality
- [ ] Perform A/B testing between database systems
- [ ] Measure performance metrics

### 4.3 Validation Checklist
- [ ] Data integrity checks
- [ ] Application functionality with both databases
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Security compliance

## Phase 5: Production Deployment

### 5.1 Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Schedule maintenance window
- [ ] Notify all stakeholders
- [ ] Create full backup of production SQLite database
- [ ] Freeze code deployments

### 5.2 Deployment Steps
1. Deploy abstraction layer to production (still using SQLite)
2. Verify application functionality with abstraction layer
3. Set up production PostgreSQL database
4. Run migration scripts to transfer data
5. Validate data integrity
6. Update configuration to use PostgreSQL
7. Monitor system closely

### 5.3 Success Criteria
- [ ] Abstraction layer functioning correctly
- [ ] All data migrated successfully
- [ ] Application functioning normally with PostgreSQL
- [ ] Performance metrics meeting targets
- [ ] No security issues identified

## Phase 6: Optimization

### 6.1 PostgreSQL Optimization
- [ ] Implement PostgreSQL-specific optimizations
- [ ] Configure connection pooling for production workloads
- [ ] Set up PostgreSQL monitoring and maintenance
- [ ] Optimize queries for PostgreSQL

### 6.2 Long-term Strategy
- [ ] Decide whether to maintain dual-database support
- [ ] If keeping dual support, document maintenance procedures
- [ ] If transitioning fully to PostgreSQL, plan for SQLite code removal
- [ ] Update development workflows for chosen strategy

## Rollback Plan

### Triggers for Rollback
- Data corruption detected
- Critical functionality broken
- Performance degradation beyond threshold
- Security vulnerabilities discovered

### Rollback Steps
1. Stop all services
2. Switch configuration back to SQLite (abstraction layer makes this simple)
3. Verify application functionality with SQLite
4. If necessary, restore from SQLite backup
5. Start services
6. Validate system state

## Post-Migration Tasks

### 7.1 Cleanup
- [ ] Archive SQLite database files (don't remove immediately)
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Archive migration scripts
- [ ] Remove temporary resources

### 7.2 Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor system performance
- [ ] Watch for error rates
- [ ] Track database metrics
- [ ] Monitor user feedback

### 7.3 Documentation
- [ ] Update system documentation
- [ ] Document lessons learned
- [ ] Update architecture diagrams
- [ ] Document the abstraction layer for future developers
